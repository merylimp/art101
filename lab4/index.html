					<h2>Making Black Milk Tea with Brown Sugar Boba</h2>
						<img src="img/boba.avif" width="400">


					<ol>
						<li>Gather all ingredients: 0.5lb bag of dried tapioca boba pearls, 0.5lb bag of loose leaf black tea, brown sugar, 0.25lb of powdered creamer, water.  </li>
						<li>Boil an entire pot of water at medium heat</li>
						<li>Once it starts boiling, add an entire bag of dried tapioca boba pearls</li>
						<li>Stir every 10 minutes for 30 minutes, making sure the pearls don't stick to the bottom of the pot</li>
						<li>Once the 30 minutes are up, pour the pot over a large strainer. Rinse the pearls under cold water</li>
						<li>In a separate container, add 1.5 cups of cold water and 1 cup of brown sugar. Stir until sugar has dissolved</li>
						<li>Add the pearls into the container with the brown sugar syrup. Stir to incorporate completely.</li>
						<li>Set aside pearls for later. In another large pot, fill it up 3/4 with water to boil.</li>
						<li>Once the water starts to boil, add entire bag of loose black tea leaves into the pot. Cover the pot with the lid.</li>
						<li>Turn the heat down to medium. Wait 10 minutes for the tea to steep.</li>
						<li>After 10 minutes, turn off the heat and let it set for 5 more minutes. Then, scoop out the tea leaves with a large strainer as soon as the time is up to prevent bitterness.</li>
						<li>Add ice into the pot until the tea level reaches the top. Stir until the ice melts.</li>
						<li>Pour the tea into a separate large container. Add 24 oz powdered creamer and stir until thoroughly combined.</li>
						<li>Add one scoop of boba pearls into a cup. Then add desired amount of ice. </li>
						<li>Add desired amount of tea, followed by desired amount of sugar into the cup.</li>
						<li>Stir drink until fully incorporated.</li>
						<li>Sip and enjoy the milk tea with a boba straw!</li>
						</li>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<pre><code>
					//Create 2 rows x 2 columns of solid squares. With the variable 1 placed inside each square. 
					//Make the top row of squares pink, and the bottom row of squares purple. 
					//Bottom row of squares corresponds to Player 1, top row is for Player 2.  
					//Each square represents a hand.
					//Player 1 starts the game by clicking on one of their “hands.” 
					//Accept user input after every move/click. 
					//After the hand is selected, Player 1 is allowed to click one of their opponent’s “hands.” 
					//The variable value in Player 1’s hand adds to the variable number of the hand of Player 2 that Player 1 selected. 
					//The number in Player 2’s square changes once the move is completed. Player 1’s stays unchanged. 
					//Turn is changed to Player 2
					// Now it is Player 2’s turn to select one of their own “hands” and add the amount present to any of Player 1’s “hands” by selecting which “hand” they want to add to.
					//Each player takes turns making moves.
					//If both a Player’s hands add to an even number, the total amount can be equally split between the two hands.”
					//Splitting can occur when the Player selects both of their boxes. 
					//Splitting counts as the Player’s move for that turn. 
					//Each “hand” limit is 5. Once the “hand” reaches 5, it resets to 0. 
					//Once a Player’s “hands” both reach a value of  0, they lose. Their opponent wins. Game is over. 
					//Game resets back to 4 squares, each having the default number 1, until Player 1 starts the game again.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Psuedocoding the computer game was definitely the most challenging. Aligning our pre-code text without going off the  "challenge" div was difficult. I was able to solve it by finding a code on stack overflow that allowed me to center the pre code in CSS. We are still unsure if we completed the javascript portion correctly. 
					I did my best, and after many trials and errors, it looks okay. Hopefully, next time I can do better.  </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment took a long time. It was frustrating at times to get the code to work. The instructions were a bit vague/confusing to us for this lab, but we did our best to interpret and follow the directions.  </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>For all lists, see above sections. We made a psuedocoded list on how to make boba. Then another psuedocode in Java for the game "chopsticks" under the "challenges" section. </p>

			<h1>Meryl's World</h1>
			<p> My partner and I recently just found out we went to all the same schools from 
				kindergarten all the way up to now in university! Even though we first met in high school through a club we were both involved in. We are also from the same city so we are able to work together conveniently.  </p>

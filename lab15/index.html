			<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
			<div id="Challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we had to experiment with jQuery and AJAX to implement an API. </p>
			</div>

			<div id="Problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Firstly, we decided to use an API that no longer existed, so that set us back on time. Secondly, we both forgot to put the event listener lol but that was a quick fix. Then, my button still wouldn't work because I accidentally capitalized the output and it didn't read. Odette helped me a lot with formatting and syntax errors I would make. </p>

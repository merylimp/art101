			<h1>Lab X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we had to experiment with JavaScript arrays and objects by coding informatioin about our main sources of transportation in our daily lives.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose were that I would mistype code and it wouldn't work. The only output I'd see is [object, object] in my browser console. I didn't want to clear the entire page so I ended up just leaving it in. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I did my best to follow the instructions and guidelines for this assignment. However, I think I need to do some further research on my own about what does certain code mean. For example, JSON. I just wrote it down because the directions say so, but we never went over it in class so I'm still wondering what the exact purpose for it is. </p>

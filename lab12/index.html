					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> We had to create a function that depends on conditionals.  </p>

			<div id="Problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first, figuring out where exactly to place my conditionals was difficult and I struggled a lot. For this lab, I had a HUGEEE help from ChatGPT answering my questions and helping me style the webpage to my liking. I asked for help on having certain images show up based on the answers given, as well as adding on to the CSS by making it more visually pleasing. I also asked help from my partner, and comparing her code to mine was extremely useful for me.  </p>
